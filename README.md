# My vimrc profile

##Instructions

- Copy "vimrc" to your original "vimrc" path ( If you are using Windows, your public vimrc file shoule be in the folder which you installed Vim. Else if you're using Linux, you should turn to change /etc/vim/vimrc or /etc/vimrc ). 
- Move "plug.vim"(Author of Vim-Plug: [junegunn](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)) to /vim/vimxx/autoload/ (vimxx means your current using vim version). 
- If you are using Windows and you want to make your Gvim transparent, move "vimtweak32.dll" and "vimtweak64.dll" to your /vim/vimxx/ (vimxx means your current using vim version) (Contributor of vimtweak I'm in use: [mattn](https://github.com/mattn/vimtweak)). If you are using Linux and prefer terminal-version vim, you can make it by turning terminal transparent. More details about vimtweak, see [mattn/vimtweak](https://github.com/mattn/vimtweak) and [www.vim.org](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=687)
- If you are using Windows and you want to make your Gvim support fullscreen, move "gvimfullscreen.dll" and "gvimfullscreen.dll.x64" to /vim/vimxx . For more information about the plugin, turn to [xqin/gvimfullscreen](https://github.com/xqin/gvimfullscreen). If you are using Linux, you may need to check window manager of Linux. 
- Type "Issues" if you want to get more help.
